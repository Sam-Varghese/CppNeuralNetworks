## Neural Network

- [Neural Network](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Artificial_neural_network) are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that constitute of [neurons](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Neuron) (artificial).
- Neurons are connected to each other and are able to send signals to other neurons.
- Current neural networks are used through [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
- But in order to enhance the speed of neural networks, we need to implement them in C++.
- [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is using neural networks to make their cars drive themselves.
- Their neural networks are implemented in C++ for speed.
- They even built their own C++ compiler for their neural networks.
- Hence with the intention of learning things from scratch, and utilising the amazing speed of C++ programming language, I'm trying to implement neural networks in C++.

## Tasks

- [x] Create classes for Neurons, Layers, and the neural network.
- [x] Implement [Feed forward algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Feedforward_neural_network) for the neural network.
- [ ] Implement [Backpropagation algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Backpropagation) for the neural network.
- [ ] Implement this neural network for image classification, and other projects.
